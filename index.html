    <h1>Happy Birthday, Papa!</h1>
    <p>Thank you for everything. Thank you for your unconditional love and for always supporting me in my dreams. I wish you a healthy life and the strength to keep going for us, your children.</p>
    <p>Just three more years, and I’ll graduate. Konti nalang, and I’ll be able to help you too. I hope you won’t be burdened by problems anymore. Stay strong, always.</p>
    <p>I’m sorry for the pain Mama caused I was the one who said sorry in her place, and I hope someday I can repay all the love and sacrifices you’ve made for us.</p>
    <p>Thank you for treating me like your own child. Never not even once did I feel like I was adopted. I always felt truly loved.</p>
    <p>Maraming, maraming salamat sa lahat, Papa. You are a blessing in my life, and I’m so grateful to call you my father.</p>
    <p class="footer">I love you. Happy birthday again!</p>
